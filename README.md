# Epics Dynamic App

This React project dynamically maps a JSON structure of Epics, User Stories, and Tasks into pages, features, and interactive task UIs.

## Features

- Each Epic becomes its own page/route.
- Each User Story is a React component feature.
- Each Task becomes real interactivity inside the User Story.
- All is generated dynamically from `src/data/epics.json`.

## Getting Started

1. Install:

   
   npm install
   
2. Run:

   
   npm run dev
   
3. Visit http://localhost:5173

You can adjust `src/data/epics.json` to define your own epics, stories, and tasks!
