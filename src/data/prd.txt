Epics Agile Demo App

Purpose:
A sample webapp for dynamic mapping of Agile PBIs (Epics → User Stories → Tasks) to interactive product features, to demonstrate full PRD-to-code coverage and rapid prototyping.

Target Users:
- Product owners: Viewing Epics/Stories/Tasks mapped to real UI.
- Developers: Modify PBIs/PRD and instantly see the impact.
- Stakeholders: Validate PRD coverage visually.

Key Features / Workflows:
- For each Epic: a navigable page.
- Each User Story: dynamic component with functional implementation.
- Each Task: a working, interactive element (form, table, chart, tracker, notification, etc).
- All pages/components are autogenerated from JSON PBIs.
- The UI updates immediately when PBIs or PRD change.
- All acceptance criteria or workflow flows are visible to users.

Constraints:
- No task/story/epic names hardcoded into implementation.
- Must update at runtime when PBIs JSON/PRD changes, no code edits.
- Must demonstrate coverage of all PRD requirements via PBI mapping.
